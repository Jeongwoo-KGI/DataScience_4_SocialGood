 **1. Project Title**
  - Estimating the likelihood of a product matching its description on Amazon based on product reviews.

 **2. Research Question**
  - How do we get the estimation of the likelihood from the sentimental analysis of product reviews. 

 **3. 1-page justification**
  - See the docx file in the repo. 

 **4. Data collection strategy**
  - We used already existing datasets from papers who have investigated similar research questions/have worked with similar datasets. 
 
 **5. Codebook** 
  - Check the repo
 
 **6. Dataset**
  - The full 30gb dataset has not been provided to us by the people who own the dataset yet, and for now, we are including just a smaller dataset which was provided by them.
